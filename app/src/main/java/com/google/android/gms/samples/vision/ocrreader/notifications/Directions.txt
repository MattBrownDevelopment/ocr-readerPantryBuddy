** AppPackageName probably is the same as AppName

1. Place the notifications package in the main package of the new app's java folder. (java/com.AppName.user.AppPackageName)
    When the package is added, it may automatically update the namespace of the package to the app it is added to.
    However, if it doesn't, com.backgroundservice.mkr.backgroundservice.notifications will need to be changed to:
        com.AppName.user.AppPackageName.notifications in all classes within the notifications package.

2. Make sure the service tag is added to the new apps AndroidManifest.xml
    <service
        android:name=".notifications.NotificationService"
        android:exported="false"/>

3. Wherever the service is going to be turned on and off (potentially the pantry item background service for checking low items),
    the service will need to be imported.
        import com.AppName.user.AppPackageName.notifications.NotificationService;

    Also, the state boolean of the service will need to be added, as well as the turn on and off methods.
        private boolean notificationsOn = false;
        private void startNotificationService()
        private void stopNotificationService()

4. The NotificationService class needs the R package imported.

    import com.backgroundservice.mkr.backgroundservice.R  change to import com.AppName.user.AppPackageName.R

5. Include the permissions in the AndroidActivity.xml:
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
